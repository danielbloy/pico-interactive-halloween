# This is designed to run on a desktop computer and perform the display of set of videos.
# Each time the application is triggered, the set of videos to play will be randomly
# selected from the configuration data based on weight. A video set consists of a list of
# videos to play and the timing intervals to play them at.
#
# A simplified TRIGGER_VIDEO value dispenses with the more complex TRIGGER_VIDEOS and
# simply overwrites it so that only a single video is played.
