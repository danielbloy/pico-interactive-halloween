# Layout

The display area is split into `zones` as follows (left and right sides are from the
perspective of facing the house). Note, over time, more `zones` have been added to
the display area so all installations do not necessarily use all `zones`.

* Path
* Door, end of path
* Square shingle, right of path
* Lounge, right of path
* Large bedroom, above lounge, right of path
* Left triangle flower bed left of path
* Small bedroom, above triangle flower bed, left of path
* Shingle drive, left of triangle flower bed
* Cabin, back of shingle drive.

The floor plan looks like this (not to scale):
