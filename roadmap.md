# Roadmap

Key planned changes:

* Remove more wi-fi, using hardcoded cables instead
* Better sensor/trigger system. Fewer false positives and quicker to act.
* More waterproofing and compact boxes to hold electronis
* Even better power distribution
* Move to high quality audio using separate controllers or I2S.
* Larger powered speakers
* Coffin that shakes and makes noises
* Boxs that opens with eyes
* Moving spiders
* Multiple separate thunder and lightning boxes to make the effect isntallation
  wide rather than just in the spider enclosure
* Audio quality using PWM and filter is not fantastic, switch to I2S or 3A+
* Support for Raspberry Pi (3A+ and Zero 2W)
