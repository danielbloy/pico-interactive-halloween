* Path has 2 Mark 2 boxes + 2 mark 1 power source boxes
* Graveyard has a Mark 2 box with flash and Mark 1 spiders
* Graveyard has a Raspberry Pi sound box.
* Sensors are Mark 2 sensor platforms, powered by batteries.

Priority list of boxes to upgrade:

* All Mark 1 boxes for the witch should be replaced with new Mark 3a/b boxes.
  * Mark 3a boxes need to come in single extendable flavour:
    * 1 Pico internally
    * All should have external power connector.
    * All should have in-built sound capability
    * All should have 1 x 3 pin connector - suitable for neopixels
    * All should have 1 x UART for external control.
    * Optional Pi Pico or Zero 2 (not both)
    * Optional multiple other connectors - 3 pins.
      * Motors can be driven as external pluggable boxes.
  * Mark 3b boxes need to come in multiple flavours:
    * 1 or 2 Pi Picos
    * Internal battery or external power (not both)
    * in-built audio
    * Multiple UARTs
    * Multiple NeoPixels
    * Multiple Motor drivers.
    * Optional Raspberry Pi 3A or Zero 2
      * optional external audio for Pi 3a
  
* New sensor platform to detect victims.

Priority list of items to do:

* Come up with a much better power distribution system for the entire display
  based on mains power distribution to each zone.
* Finalise the design and manufacture the weatherproof 3D printed boxes
  that will house the Pico and/or Pi electronics.
* Finalise the design and manufacture the new Pico based circuit boards
  for the electronics for the 3D printed boxes.
* Design and implement a much better and more reliable human detection
  system to activate the display.
* Migrate all primary networking and control to Raspberry Pi devices.

* [ ] Setup Raspberry Pis to run Python script automatically upon startup.
* [ ] Improved trigger sensors.
* [ ] Add capacitors to lightning box to avoid reset due to drain from power spike.

Stretch items:

* [ ] Setup a Raspberry Pi 3A+ to run audio and trigger other devices via WiFi.
* [ ] Add another projector.
