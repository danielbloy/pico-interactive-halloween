# Halloween 2025

Both the 2023 and 2024 displays took a massive amount of time to design and build. This was
in part because I was learning what worked and what didn't as I went along as well as building
everything from scratch. The amount of time invested was also so significant that it made it
very difficult to progress other projects that I'm working on. So for 2025, I'm focussing on
using what I already have and turning that into a more coherent display. Crucially, part of the
display will be covered to protect it from the elements and this opens it up to much more
impressive display possibilities. It also means my daughter can take a larger part in designing
and building the project; particularly the witches house.

Also, as I've learnt so much about what dorks and what doesn't, I'm designing all-new control
boxes and a completely new software stack using everything I've learnt so far. Unlike previous
years I'm not rushing to put them into production. Rather I will be working on the boxes, the
software stack and the new circuit boards over 2025 and through into 2026 with a view to replace
the older 2023 boxes first. If you are interested, the new software stack can be found at
[cptkip](https://github.com/danielbloy/cptkip).

## Key changes from previous years

For a description of how the installation area is arranged and split into "zones", please
refer to [layout](./layout.md).

This year we are going for a different arrangement to the display to avoid the concept getting
stale. The primary part of the display is a new witches hut that will be a covered display
(its a 3m by 3m gazebo).
