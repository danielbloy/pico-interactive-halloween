# Halloween 2025

Both the 2023 and 2024 displays took a massive amount of time to design and build. This was
in part because I was learning what worked and what didn't as I went along as well as building
everything from scratch. The amount of time invested was also so significant that it made it
very difficult to progress other projects that I'm working on. So for 2025, I'm focussing on
using what I already have and turning that into a more coherent display. Crucially, part of the
display will be covered to protect it from the elements and this opens it up to much more
impressive display possibilities. It also means my daughter can take a larger part in designing
and building the project; particularly the witches house.

Also, as I've learnt so much about what dorks and what doesn't, I'm designing all-new control
boxes and a completely new software stack using everything I've learnt so far. Unlike previous
years I'm not rushing to put them into production. Rather I will be working on the boxes, the
software stack and the new circuit boards over 2025 and through into 2026 with a view to replace
the older 2023 boxes first. If you are interested, the new software stack can be found at
[cptkip](https://github.com/danielbloy/cptkip).

## Key changes from previous years

For a description of how the installation area is arranged and split into "zones", please
refer to [layout](./layout.md).

This year we are going for a different arrangement to the display to avoid the concept getting
stale. The primary part of the display is a new witches hut that will be a covered display
(its a 3m by 3m gazebo).

## Priority list of tasks

* [ ] Undertake a full inventory of devices.
* [ ] Design and manufacture new eyes.
* [ ] Design and manufacture skull holders.
* [ ] Build Raspberry Pi 3 machine with instructions.
* [ ] Build Raspberry Pi 400 machine with instructions.
* [ ] Validate the video playback works (well enough) on a Raspberry Pi.
* [ ] Add support for playing sounds at the same time as movies in Video node.

## Path, sensors and skulls

This part of the display will be much the same as 2024. There will be 6 skulls down
each side of the path. These will flicker when turned on. They will come on in time
to the bells in the primary audio. There are additional dragon and lion sound effects
and for 2025 these will be changed. The dragon effects will be removed so they can be
reused with the bedroom dragon. Another minor change to 2024 is that the skulls will
be mounted on brackets rather than stood on the path. This is to avoid them being
accidentally kicked over.

The sensors will be at the entrance to the path and trigger the display.

Display elements:

* Sensors at the path entrance.
* Skulls down each side of the path, connected by a long cable for synchronisation.

Outstanding items:

* [ ] Finish the design of the skull mount.
* [ ] Manufacture the skull mounts.
* [ ] Review the sounds that are played.

Stretch items:

* [ ] Improved trigger sensors.

## Square shingle, graveyard

The square shingle is to the right-hand side of the path and will be completely
different for 2025. The entire area will be a graveyard (in the 2024 display, the
graveyard was spread across the full front garden). A smoke machine will be
installed close to the house using ice to keep the smoke at a low level and avoid
full dispersal. The lightning box will be installed close to the smoke machine
for an additional effect. One or more sound boxes will be installed to provide
sound effects.

Display elements:

* Gravestones.
* Skeletons, spiders.
* Smoke machine.
* Lightning box.
* Sound boxes.

Outstanding items:

* [x] Purchase smoke machine and liquid
* [x] Purchase additional skeleton and bones.
* [x] Varnish the wooden gravestones.
* [x] Buy additional gravestones.
* [ ] Construct robust mounts for gravestones.
* [ ] Construct one or two additional sound boxes.
* [ ] Select sounds.

Stretch items:

* [ ] Add capacitors to lightning box to avoid reset due to drain from power spike.

## Lounge, projector

The lounge is on the right-hand side of the path behind the square shingle and
will be the same setup as 2024 with a single projector and speakers. This will
project videos of dancing villains and skeletons.

Display elements:

* Raspberry Pi, Projector and speakers.

Outstanding items:

* [ ] Build Raspberry Pi 400, making notes.
* [ ] Review the videos to display and timings.
* [x] Purchase projector stand.

## Large bedroom, dragon attractor

The large bedroom is on the right-hand side of the path above the lounge. This
will be the same as 2024 and contain the dragon eyes on a TV which will be setup
as a permanent attractor. The dragon noises used elsewhere in the installation
will be removed so they can be used solely as part of this display. The TV will
be decorated so that it looks like a dragon and a new fire effect will be added
in the background using the 2024 Santa Detector item.

Display elements:

* Raspberry Pi, TV for dragon eyes.
* Raspberry Pi with speakers for dragon sounds.
* Fire effect using microphone to adapt to noise.

Outstanding items:

* [ ] Add background fire effect using Santa Detector.
* [ ] Decorate TV screen to look like a dragon.
* [ ] Migrate to using Raspberry Pi over a windows PC for video.
* [x] Build an application based on Video to play audio for Raspberry Pi/PC.
* [ ] Build Raspberry Pi 400, making notes.
* [ ] Build Raspberry Pi 3, making notes
* [x] Purchase speakers.
* [ ] Add dragon sound effects.

## Triangle flower bed, pumpkin patch

The triangle flower bed is to the left of the path and will be an all new display
for 2025. It will be a pumpkin patch with a pumpkin head scarecrow. The pumpkins
will have atomisers to provide a light smoking effect and the scarecrow will have
LCD screens for eyes. The LCD screens will be a remake of the MakeCode Arcade eyes
used in the creepy head for the 2023 and 2024 displays. The pumpkin head scarecrow
is going to be built by Amelia. Ideally we'd have another sound box to allow for
sounds to be played.

Display elements:

* Carved pumpkins with team lights

Outstanding items:

* [ ] Build LCD eyes (MakeCode Arcade) for pumpkin head scarecrow.
* [ ] Build atomising extension cables for misters.
* [ ] Test atomising misters.
* [ ] Carve pumpkins and install tea lights.

Stretch items:

* [ ] Construct a sound box.

## Gravel drive, witches house

The witches house is a completely new installation for 2025. It will be mostly
made up from repurposed components from other parts of the display from 2024
and new items made. The witches house will have a table and Hazel (our resident
mannequin) made up as a witch. Amelia will choose and make most of the decorations.
There will be a cauldron sitting above a fireplace. For 2025, the fireplace will
be a new item that was made for the Denver Primary School play. It'll need fixing
up to repair some of the damage made by the children in the play. The cauldron will
need to be placed on a stand above the fire and will have lights and the atomiser
from 2024 to give a smoke effect.

Because the wi-fi range of the Picos could be an issue, this installation may need
to be driven by a Raspberry Pi.

Display elements:

* Hazel the witch.
* Cauldron and fire.
* Witches table.

Outstanding items:

* [ ] Purchase new gazebo.
* [ ] Repair the school fire prop.
* [ ] Upgrade the school fire prop to make sound and noise when triggered.
* [ ] Build a cauldron stand.
* [ ] Review the witches sounds.

Stretch items:

* [ ] Add a projector.
